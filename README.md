## Our Goals

### Creation of an in-browser REPL for the Ruby 2.1.1 Ruby Standard Library 
* This will be a learning tool for the community. Anyone will be able to try out the elements of the Ruby 2.1.1 Ruby Standard Library easily on the website. 
* The open source Rails App TryRuby, https://github.com/Sophrinix/TryRuby, will be used as a template.
* Improvements to the code base of TryRuby will be made including
updating the Rails version and re-factoring.

### Launch a Rails site so the community can easily try out the Standard Library elements.

### Use Sinatra to blog about the progress and challenges of the creation.

#### This project involves Reading, Writing and Coding.
*    Reading - understanding the Ruby Standard Library
*    Writing - writing the guides
*    Coding - creating the repl, the site to host it on, refactoring the code base

Jennifer and Stephanie will have a much deeper understanding of Ruby and Rails by the end of this project as well as having created something very useful for the community.
