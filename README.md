## Goals of The Standard Librarians

#### Learn and become confident with our code.

#### Launch a Rails site so the community can easily try out some of the elements of the Ruby Standard Library.

* Create of an in-browser REPL for the Ruby 2.1.2 Ruby Standard Library like TryRuby.org.
* Create an open source learning tool for the community. 
* Making the Ruby Standard Library more accessable for beginners.

#### Use Sinatra to blog about the progress and challenges of the creation. We are using Nesta.

This project involves understanding the Ruby Standard Library, writing guides explaining it, 
creating a repl and the Rails site to host it on.
