## Goals of The Standard Librarians

#### Creation of an in-browser REPL for the Ruby 2.1.2 Ruby Standard Library 
* This will be a learning tool for the community. Anyone will be able to try out the 
elements of the Ruby Standard Library easily on the website. 
* Making the Ruby Standard Library more accessable for beginners.

#### Launch a Rails site so the community can easily try out the Standard Library elements.

#### Use Sinatra to blog about the progress and challenges of the creation. We are using Nesta.

This project involves understanding the Ruby Standard Library, writing the guides, 
creating a repl and the Rails site to host it on.
