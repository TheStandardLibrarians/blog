# Ripl.start

Today we worked on the narrative text so we can get a leg up on the story.

Tonight we continued our exploration of Ripl. We are now trying to run it in a browser.

webtest_helper.rb

lib/ripl/shell.rb

Why instantiate a class? If you need a unique state.  
This is the difference between a module and a class. A module does not need a unique state.

We used the Ripl.start method  
$Ripl.shell.eval_input("RUBY_VERSION")  
build status header and body

in the webtest_controller.rb..

    def index  
      render text:Ripl.shell.eval_input("2+2")  
    end

We set up port forwarding in our Vagrantfile  
  guest 3000 host 300
