# Stephanie Betancourt

I'm a web professional working in the Los Angeles area, currently obsessed with vinyl and Raspberry Pi. And real pie, for that matter. See [http://www.stephaniebetancourt.com/blog](my blog) for further ramblings. Or my [http://www.github.com/stephaniebetancourt](github) for my code.
