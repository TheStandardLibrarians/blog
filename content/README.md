## Posting to the Standard Librarians blog.

Create a new document inside of the $content/pages directory.

It is easiest to run `$ cp <an-old-blog-post-filename.mdown>  <your-new-post-filename.mdown>`

Name it with the appropriate date and your name like this:
wk04-day13-wed-yourname-rgsoc-standardlibrarians.mdown

Formatting is crucial for your post to show up on the site.  
There are 3 elements that you cannot vary from  

1. the Date 
2. the author
3. an h1 tag


like this:  
Date: 23 July 2014  
Author: your name  

/# Your Heading


The easiest thing to do is to use an old post, rename it and change the info.

To run it locally run $mr-sparkle config.ru
